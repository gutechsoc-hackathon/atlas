Skyscanner provides over a million users with accurate, informative travel comparison functionality. This involves the acquisition of vast amounts of data from external sources for each route, market and set of dates. We use this data to help users find the perfect flights, hotels and car hire for them.
However, we believe there is much more opportunity for our collected data and as a result, we have created an external API for our Flights product. We believe that our two API offerings for Flights are industry defining data sources that, among the other countless uses for this data, will aid others to build flight search functionality and change the way that users plan their journeys.
We will provide your team with access to our Flights API for the duration of the hackathon, and would like you to explore alternative uses of our data than we currently offer at  Skyscanner. We are excited to see the range of projects you can create that utilise our data and very much encourage your creativity for this challenge. Any entry that uses our API and the data sourced from it is a valid entry, regardless of platform, or technologies used.
